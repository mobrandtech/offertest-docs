# OfferTest Axonite Integration

### Context

 * This documentation is intended to help you integrate Mobrand's OfferTest tool into your Axonite Platform.
 * You will find instructions on how to find the required token.
 
### How it works

 * You have to configure what is the desired interval of your campaigns testing, it is in hours.
 * Also you have to insert the Ad Verification token which is given to you on axonate platform.
 * From every X ( hours ), which you have configured, a batch test will run on your campaigns, and the result is sent back to your Axonite platform.

### Where to find your AD Verification Token

 * Go to internal integration through the main menu:

 * Go to Mobrand's console and on the left menu to go - "OFFERTEST" -> "TOOLS" -> "AXONITE INTEGRATION"
